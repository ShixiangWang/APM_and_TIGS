<p>This document is compiled from an Rmarkdown file which contains all code or description necessary to reproduce the analysis for the accompanying project. Each section below describes a different component of the analysis and all numbers and figures are generated directly from the underlying data on compilation.</p>
<div id="dependencies" class="section level1">
<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>The preprocessing step is dependent on R software and some R packages, if you have not used R yet or R is not installed, please see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>.</p>
<p>R packages:</p>
<ul>

<li>readxl - read xlsx data</li>
</ul>
<p>These R packages are easily searched by internet and have no strict version requirements to reproduce the following analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-download-and-preprocessing" class="section level1">
<h1>Data download and preprocessing</h1>
<p>This part will clearly describe how to process raw data but not provide an easy script for re-running all preprocess steps just by a click due to the complexity of data preprocessing.</p>
<div id="tcga-pan-cancer-data-download" class="section level2">
<h2>TCGA Pan-cancer data download</h2>
<p>TCGA Pan-cancer data (Version 2017-10-13), including datasets of clinical informaiton, gene expression, are downloaded from <a href="https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/">UCSC Xena</a> via R package <a href="https://github.com/ShixiangWang/UCSCXenaTools">UCSCXenaTools</a>.</p>

<p>The RNASeq data we downloaded are pancan normalized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For comparing data within independent cohort (like TCGA-LUAD), we recommend to use the “gene expression RNAseq” dataset. For questions regarding the gene expression of this particular cohort in relation to other types tumors, you can use the pancan normalized version of the “gene expression RNAseq” data. For comparing with data outside TCGA, we recommend using the percentile version if the non-TCGA data is normalized by percentile ranking. For more information, please see our Data FAQ: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q-7Tkzd7pci4Rz-_IswASRMRzYrbgx1FTTfAWOyHbmk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These datasets are downloaded to local machine, we need to load them into R. However, whether filenames of datasets or contents in datasets all look messy, next we need to clean them before real analysis.</p>

<h2>Selection of APM genes and marker genes of immune cell type</h2>
<p>Marker genes for immune cell types were obtained from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27855702">Senbabaoglu, Y. et al</a>, selection of genes involved in processing and presentation of antigen (APM) was also inspired by this paper and finally 18 genes were selected based on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jnci/djt184">literature review of APM</a> and some facts that mutations or deletions affecting genes encoding APM (HLA, beta2-microglobulin, TAP1/2 etc.) may lead to <strong>reduced presentation of neoantigens</strong> by a cancer cell.</p>

<h2>Calculation of APS, TIS and IIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The GSVA package allows one to perform a change in coordinate systems of molecular measurements, transforming the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment, survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>APM score (APS) and score of each immune cell type are directly calculated from GSVA method. Aggregate TIS (T cell infiltration score) and IIS (Immune cell infiltration score) are calculated using following method, their effectiveness have been validated by many studies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TIS was defined as the mean of the standardized values for the following T cell subsets: CD8 T, T helper, T, T central and effector memory, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells. The immune infiltration score (IIS) for a sample was defined as the mean of standardized values for macrophages, DC subsets (total, plasmacytoid, immature, activated), B cells, cytotoxic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, NK cell subsets (total, CD56 bright, CD56 dim), and all T cell subsets (CD8 T, T helper, T central and effector memory, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells).

<h2>TCGA mutation download and clean</h2>
<p>We downloaded TCGA somatic mutations (data source: <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/mc3-2017">TCGA MC3</a>) via TCGAmutations package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TCGAmutations is an R data package containing somatic mutations from TCGA cohorts. This is particularly useful for those working with mutation data from TCGA studies - where most of the time is spent on searching various databases, downloading, compiling and tidying up the data before even the actual analysis is started. This package tries to mitigate the issue by providing pre-compiled, curated somatic mutations from 33 TCGA cohorts along with relevant clinical information for all sequenced samples.</p>

<h2>GEO datasets download and processing</h2>
<p>We also tried our best to collect gene expression data to extend APM score (APS), IIS etc. calculation for more cancer types by searching NCBI GEO databases. We only focus on looking for cancer types which showed in list of our immunotherapy clinical studies and not showed in TCGA studies. Finally, we found 5 GEO datasets which can extract gene expression data of Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Small Cell Lung Cancer and Cutaneous Squamous Carcinoma. Download of these datasets need R package <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GEOquery.html">GEOquery</a> is installed. Following code showed how we downloaded and carefully processed them.</p>

<h3>Immunotherapy clinical studies</h3>
<p>Collecting response rate of immunotherapy clinical studies was inspired by the paper <em>Tumor Mutational Burden and Response Rate to PD-1 inhibition</em> which published on journal NEJM, this paper showed data from about 50 stuides. However, detail values of response rate the authors collected were not published. We followed their search strategy and tried our best to find all clinical studies which recorded response rate. Totally, we reviewed abstract of over 100 clinical studies, collected response rate values, then carefully filtered them based on standard we set, selected the most respresenting data (from about 60 studies) for downstream analysis. More detail of this procedure please see <strong>Method section</strong> of our manuscript. The data we collected for analysi are double checked and open to readers as a supplementary table.</p>

<h3>Immunotherapy genomics datasets</h3>
<p>To evaluate the predictive power of TIGS in ICI clinical response prediction, we searched PubMed for ICI clinical studies with available individual patient’s TMB and gene transcriptome information. In total three datasets are identified after this search. <strong>Van Allen et al 2015 dataset</strong> was downloaded from supplementary files of reference. This dataset studied CTLA-4 blockade in metastatic melanoma, and “clinical benefit” was defined using a composite end point of complete response or partial response to CTLA-4 blockade by RECIST criteria or stable disease by RECIST criteria with overall survival greater than 1 year, “no clinical benefit” was defined as progressive disease by RECIST criteria or stable disease with overall survival less than 1 year. <strong>Hugo et al 2016 dataset</strong> was downloaded from supplementary files of reference. This dataset studied Anti-PD-1therapy in metastatic melanoma, responding tumors were derived from patients who have complete or partial responses or stable disease in response to anti-PD-1 therapy, non-responding tumors were derived from patients who had progressive disease. <strong>Snyder et al dataset</strong> was downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/hammerlab/multi-omic-urothelial-anti-pdl1" class="uri">https://github.com/hammerlab/multi-omic-urothelial-anti-pdl1</a>. This dataset studied PD-L1 blockade in urothelial cancer, and durable clinical benefit was defined as progression-free survival &gt;6 months. RNA-Seq data was used to calculate the APS for each patient. Only patients with both APS and TMB value were used to calculate the TIGS. Median of TMB or TIGS was used as the threshold to separate TMB High/Low group or TIGS High/Low group in Kaplan-Meier overall survival curve analysis.</p>

<p>We know that genes used for APS calculation does not overlap with genes of immune cell type, but we don’t know if there are association between APS and them. Besides, we also don’t know if there are association between APS and two aggregate scores: TIS and IIS.</p>
<p>The first step we want to do is show the relationships between scores using a heatmap. The correlation calculation is based on <strong>spearman</strong> method.</p>

<h3>IIS is a good representation of immune cell infiltration</h3>
<p>Immune/T cell infiltration is a good indicator for ICB response. Here we have seen that APS have strong association with both TIS and IIS. In indivial level, i.e. 9095 samples, we also observe that TIS and IIS are basically same because their correlation coeficient is about 0.91!</p>

<p>Therefore, we should choose one of them for downstream analysis. Finally, we choose IIS not only because it is more comprehensive, but also it is well validated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In vitro validation</strong> with multiplex immunofluorescence, <strong>in silico validation</strong> using simulated mixing proportions and comparison between <strong>CIBERSORT and IIS</strong> have been previously described (<strong>Senbabaoglu, Y. et al</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TIMER</strong> is another method that can accurately resolve relative fractions of diverse cell types based on gene expression profiles from complex tissues. <strong>To further validate the calculated IIS, we perform TIMER analysis and find that the result of TIMER is highly correlated with the calculated IIS</strong>.</p>

<p>Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is defined as <strong>the number of non-synonymous alterations per megabase (Mb) of genome examined</strong>. As reported previously, here we use 38 Mb as the estimate of the exome size. For studies reporting mutation number from whole exome sequencing, the normalized TMB = (whole exome non-synonymous mutation)/(38 Mb).</p>
<p>Original APM scores (APS) from GSVA are in the range of -1 to 1. To calculate tumor immunogenicity score (TIGS), original APM score from GSVA implementation is rescaled by minimal and maximal APM score from TCGA Pan-cancer analysis.</p>
<p>We calculate tumor immunogenicity score (TIGS) as following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
TIGS = APS_{normalized} \times log(TMB + 1)
\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural logarithm is applied here. Of note, some tumors have TMB level below 1 mutation/ Mb, to avoid minus number in quantifying “tumor antigenicity”, we add number 1 to all normalized TMB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How we generate this TIGS formula will be described at an individual part. <strong>Here we focus on association of APS, TMB and TIGS and their effects.</strong></p>

<h2>Gene sets enriched in patients with high APM score</h2>
<p>To identify the <strong>specific gene sets/pathway</strong> associated with high APS, we firstly run differential gene expression analysis for each TCGA cancer type based on APS status. Patients with APS of first quartile was defined as “APS-High”, patients with APS of the forth quartile was defined as “APS-Low”. Genes with p value &lt;0.01 and FDR &lt;0.05 were ranked by logFC from top to bottom and then inputted into GSEA function of R package <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/clusterProfiler/inst/doc/clusterProfiler.html"><strong>clusterProfiler</strong></a> with custom gene sets download from <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp"><strong>Molecular Signature Database v6.2</strong></a>. Normalized enrichment score (NES) was used to rank the differentially enriched gene sets. In results from hallmark gene sets, several gene signatures (especially interferon alpha/gamma response) were found to be enriched in most TCGA cancer types with high APS, suggesting high APS are strongly associated with interferon alpha/gamma signaling pathway.</p>
<p>The code below is runned on linux server (need much time), thus if reader wanna reproduce it, you may need to download gene sets from <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp"><strong>Molecular Signature Database v6.2</strong></a> and modify some file path.</p>

<h1>Immunotherapy datasets analyses</h1>
<p>This part will clearly describe how to analyze APS, TMB and TIGS in immunotherapy datasets, including cancer type level and individual level. Raw data used for these analyses have been preprocessed, detail please read preprocessing part or TCGA pan-cancer analyses of this analysis report.</p>
<div id="tigs-and-pan-cancer-objective-response-rate-to-pd-1-inhibition" class="section level2">
<h2>TIGS and pan-cancer objective response rate to PD-1 inhibition</h2>
<p>Previous study has shown that TMB could predict pan-cancer ICI objective response rates (ORR). Here we will evaluate and compare the predictive power of APS, TIGS with TMB in pan-cancer ICI objective response rates prediction. The ORR for anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 therapy will be plotted against the corresponding median APS, TIGS, TMB across multiple cancer types.</p>
<p>Through an extensive literature search, we identified 26 tumor types or subtypes for which data regarding the ORR are available. For each tumor type, we pooled the response data from the largest published studies that evaluated the ORR. We included only studies of anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 monotherapy that enrolled at least 10 patients who were not selected for PD-L1 tumor expression (Identified individual studies and references are available in the manuscript Supplementary Table 3). The median tumor mutational burden for each tumor type was obtained from a validated comprehensive genomic profiling assay performed and provided by Foundation Medicine. The APS information for 23 tumor types were calculated based on TCGA datasets, and the APS for merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer were calculated based on GEO microarray datasets.</p>
<div id="combination-of-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>Combination of datasets</h3>
<p>In code implementation, we firstly combine APM score, TIGS score from TCGA studies and GEO datasets.</p>

<p>We observe that 28% variance of ORR can be explained by APS, and 44% variance of ORR can be explained by TMB. The result of TMB is similar to NEJM paper <em>Tumor Mutational Burden and Response Rate to PD-1 inhibition</em>. <strong>This result show that TMB and APS are biomarker that predicting ORR of immunotherapy, TMB is better than APS</strong>.</p>

<h3>TIGS definition and performance</h3>
<p>From the aspect of biological process, TMB release is independent from processing and presentation of tumor antigens. Now that we have found TMB and APM are biomarkers which can predict object reponse rate of cancer type in immunotherapy, these two factors are independent, and are both required for tumor immunogenicity determination, <strong>why not integrate them as a new biomarker which should be better than TMB?</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, theoretically, tumor immunogenicity can be represented as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[“Tumor \quad antigenicity”] \times [“Antigen \quad processing \quad and \quad presenting \quad status”].
\]</span></p>
<p>We use <code>log(TMB)</code> here because <code>log(TMB)</code> has been proved to have a linear relationship with ORR. So the formula can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
TIGS = APS_{normalized} \times log(TMB) 
\]</span></p>
<p>However, some tumors have TMB level below 1 mutation/ Mb, to avoid minus number in quantifying “tumor antigenicity”, we add number 1 to all normalized TMB. So in this case, the TIGS formula is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
TIGS = APS_{normalized} \times log(TMB + 1) 
\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When TMB &lt; 1 mutation/Mb, the <code>log(TMB)</code> would less than 0, if APS is very big, we would get a big minus number in this case, which against common sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we construct a linear model by integrate TMB and APM.</p>

<h3>More exploration of TIGS formula</h3>
<p><strong>Would other combination of TMB and APS be better?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, we constructed the formula of <code>TIGS</code> according to our understanding of “tumor antigenicity”. Is there a better combination of these two factors?</p>
<p>There are three basic models we take into consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model 1: <span class="math inline">\(ORR = d \times (a \times APS + b\times log(TMB)) + c\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(TIGS = a \times APS + b \times log(TMB)\)</span></li>
<li>Model 2: <span class="math inline">\(ORR = a \times (APS \times log(TMB)) + b\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(TIGS = APS \times log(TMB)\)</span> (This is the model we used above)</li>
<li>Model 3: <span class="math inline">\(ORR = e \times (a \times APS + b\times log(TMB) + c\times APS \times log(TMB)) + d\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(TIGS = a \times APS + b\times log(TMB) + c\times APS \times log(TMB)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>a, b, c, d and e here are coefficients. In R, we don’t need to write them in models, it will take care of them.</p>
<p>Now, let’s observe the results.</p>

<p>The model 1 is the worst one. Model 3 is a little better than model 2, however model 2 is much simpler (model 2 is included in model 3!). Following <strong>Occam’s razor</strong>, we choose model 2 when compare it with model 3. We also choose model 2 when compare it with model 1 because it is better and consist with the fact APM and TMB are relatively independent but not absolutely independent. To summary, model 2 is the best option.</p>
<p><strong>Any promotion of formula <span class="math inline">\(TIGS = APS \times log(TMB + 1)\)</span>?</strong></p>
<p>We still have a question about TIGS formula. The TMB in formula is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
TMB = ln(\frac{whole \quad exome  \quad mutation \quad number}{38} + 1 )
\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We choose nonsynonymous mutations because they have functional effects. Only functional effects on protein will generate neo-antigen (peptide).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use 38 here because 38 MB is the estimated length of exome, so we can normalize TMB to per MB. However, in math model, there may be a better value “a” than 38. We don’t know yet, so we need to explore this “a” value.</p>
<p>We simulate “a” value from 0.1 to 10000 with step size 0.1 in the following formula, the resulted TIGS is then used to fit a linear model for pan-cancer ICI ORR prediction. We calculate differnt R Square value under each “a” and see how it changes.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
TIGS = APS_{normalized} \times ln(\frac{whole \quad exome \quad mutation \quad number}{a} + 1)
\]</span></p>

<p>We can find that R squares of linear model have a maximum value when “a” is around 40. Therefore, “a=38” is optimized to rescale the raw whole exome mutation counts and balance the contribution for APM and TMB in TIGS formula.</p>

<h2>Performance comparison on immunotherapy clinical response prediction and survival benefit</h2>
<p>Description of datasets please see preprocessing part or “Method Section” of manuscript.</p>
<p>TMB is a well-known biomarker and has been applied. Considering our TIGS is based on TMB, thus the most important point we wanna do in this section is comparing the prediction/clinical perfermance between TMB and TIGS.</p>
<p>However, some other biomarkers can predict immunotherapy response have been studied by other groups. Therefore, this section we will include following biomarkers in comparsion.</p>
<ul>
<li>APS - antigen processing and presenting efficiency score</li>
<li>TMB - tumor mutation burden</li>
<li>TIGS - tumor immunogenicity score</li>
<li>IIS - immune infiltration score</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/91190#SEC4">IFNG</a> - interferon gamma response biomarkers of 6 genes including <em>IFNG, STAT1, IDO1, CXCL10, CXCL9</em>, and <em>HLA-DRA</em></li>
<li>CD8 - gene expression level of CD8A + CD8B</li>
<li>PDL1 - an immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarker approved by FDA. This study we use <em>PD-L1</em> gene expression as the IHC surrogate</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0136-1">TIDE</a> - TIDE signature which integrates the expression signatures of T cell dysfunction and T cell exclusion to model tumor immune evasion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The predicted values of gene expression biomarkers (i.e. IFNG, CD8, PDL1) are the average values among all members defined by the original publications.</p>
<div id="preprocessing-of-immunotherapy-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>Preprocessing of immunotherapy datasets</h3>
<p>The first step is to preprocess 3 immunotherapy datasets with gene expression, TMB and clinical outcome available. APS from Pancan analysis is used to normalize APS here.</p>

<p>From comparison of AUC value above, we can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>TIGS and TIDE are better than TMB</li>
<li>TIGS and TIDE have almost same performance in two melanoma datasets, however, performance of TIDE go down a little in urothelial cancer dataset, maybe resulting from the fact that TIDE is trained on data of melanoma and NSCLC cancer (this point is stated at <a href="http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu/">TIDE website</a>, cancer type except for melanoma and NSCLC may not work).</li>
<li>APS, TMB are also not bad predictors (they have almost same performance)</li>
<li>Other predictors are not good predictors, they perform differently in different datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we summary results above for final visualization.</p>

<p>From comparison of cox results and K-M plots above, we can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>TIGS is very robust, in all three datasets, “High group” all show statistically significant better survival than “Low group”.</li>
<li>TIDE performs just so-so in Hugo 2016 dataset, very good in Van Allen 2015 dataset. But, it losts its power in Snyder 2017 dataset, patients with low TIDE value should have better survival but in this dataset patients with high TIDE value have better survival.</li>
<li>Patients with High TMB or APS in three datasets all show trends of better survival but not statistically significant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we summary results (cox HR value and K-M fit) above for final visualization.</p>

<h2>Random selection of APM genes or IIS genes</h2>
<p>TCGA contains about 10,000 patients with RNASeq data, it is hard to simulate GSVA serveral times with whole data (too much computation), thus we using a sampling strategy as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>randomly select RNAseq data from 500 patients.</li>
<li>calculate GSVA score
<ul>
<li>calculate once from right genes.</li>
<li>randomly select genes (10 times) and run GSVA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>calculate spearman correlation coefficient for normal APS and normal IIS, random APS and normal IIS, normal APS and random IIS, respectively. The latter two have ten values, we use their mean.</li>
<li>repeat the process 100 times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GSVA score calculation is implemented by script <code>code/random_simulation.R</code> (this will take much time to finish). Next we calculate correlation using following commands.</p>
